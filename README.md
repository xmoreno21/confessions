# Sound's World Confessions

This is the source code for the anonymous confession board project by Xmo.

Anonymity: All actions are tied to anonymous user hashes that cannot be reversed except via brute forcing.
Transparency: All moderation actions are visible in the public audit log. The moderation endpoint that I may use is visible in the code and also creates an audit log entry.
