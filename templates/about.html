        <h1>Sound's World Confessions</h1>
        <h2>About this Website</h2>

        <p>Hey there, Xmo here. I'm the creator of this website. It's a simple confession board for Sound's World where people can feel free to post their hot takes, dirty laundry, or anything else really. Due to the nature of this website, I must make a few things clear.</p>
        <p>1. Transparency: You can see the audit log <a href="https://confessions.xmo.dev/audit">here</a>. This log contains all actions taken by me, the system (you users), and everyone else. This keeps me accountable so I cannot just remove something I personally dislike. This project is also open source, so you can see the source code for yourself <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>2. Anonymity: All actions taken on this website are fully anonymous. Nobody can see who is posting, upvoting, or reporting. This includes me, the site owner. I accomplished this using an non-reversible hashing function. This is to ensure that nobody feels pressured to not post something because they think someone will find out it was them.</p>
        <p>3. Moderation Limits: As the site owner, I reserve the ability to manually delete posts that are harmful or egregious - but these actions are always recorded in the audit log. I will not suspend users manually, that happens automatically based on behavior.</p>
        <p>4. Behavioral Penalties: If three of your posts are removed through community reports, you will be automatically suspended for 24 hours. This increases to three days at five removals, and permanently at eight. Posts that I remove manually do not count toward these limits, so it's ultimately up to the community to clean up harmful content.</p>
        <p>5. No Tracking: I do not log any IP addresses or other browser identifers. The only thing stored is your hashed user ID for the purposes of enforcing cooldowns and community moderation. This does not change but cannot be reverse engineered to find out who you are.</p>
        <p>6. Cooldowns: There is a five minute cooldown on each user creating a post. This is to prevent spam and low effort content.</p>
        <p>7. Other Notes: You cannot delete or edit confessions once you've made them. Everything posted is final - so think before you hit submit. The audit log is there to prove to the community that neither can I, without everyone knowing.</p>
        <p>Final Note: This is a little side project. So have fun, throw around your crazy takes about people, and enjoy.</p>
